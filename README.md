## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This project applies all material covered in the ECE 111 class. It is broken into 2 parts. The 
first is a SHA-256 hash module. This module will hash a 20 word input. 

The second part is a produce a nounce for a bitcoin block. This completed by using a modified verison of the
module from part one. This module will calculate 16 unique nounce in parrellel. 

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This code as written using System Verilog in Quartus for the Arria II GX EP2AGX45DF29I5. 

### Prerequisites
None
<!--What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```
-->
### Installing
None
<!--A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
